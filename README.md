# EverythingCalculator
A calculator that fulfills all your needs

This is a work in progress project that I am using to help teach myself python and find out how to respond to bugs
This probably will not work for a while, and is probably not going to work as originally planned

The goal of this project is to create a program that can help autofill formulas for math equations based off of the information givin
The first step is to add Area and Perimeter for different shapes, and Circumference and Radius for Circles (Pi is set as 3.142)
The next steps will fill in as the project progresses

Most calculator functions will come in as different programs for ease of bug fixing and will later be compiled into one

THIS WILL NOT HAVE A GUI
That might be added in another version of the program, If I eventually get good enough I will try to make this work on phones or desktops as an actual application with GUI.
