# EverythingCalculator
A calculator that fulfills all your needs

This is a work in progress project that I am using to help teach myself python and find out how to respond to bugs
This probably will not work for a while, and is probably not going to work as originally planned

The goal of this project is to create a program that can help autofill formulas for math equations based off of the information givin
The first step is to add Area and Perimeter for different shapes, and Circumference and Radius for Circles (Pi is set as 3.142)
The next steps will fill in as the project progresses
